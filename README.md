# Complete Data Pipeline Data Engineering Project using Spotify 🎵

## Introduction 🎧

This data engineering project demonstrates the creation of a complete data pipeline for extracting and processing data from Spotify. We will integrate with the Spotify API to extract data, deploy the code on AWS Lambda for automatic extraction, and set up triggers for data extraction and transformation. The project will involve writing a transformation function, storing files properly on AWS S3, and building analytics tables using Glue and Athena.

## Steps 🚀

1. **Integrating with Spotify API and Extracting Data** 📊
   - Create a Spotify Developer Account and obtain the necessary credentials.
   - Use the Spotify API to access and extract data from the Spotify platform.
   - Set up the required libraries and authentication for interacting with the API.

2. **Deploying Code on AWS Lambda for Data Extraction** 🚀
   - Package and deploy the data extraction code to AWS Lambda.
   - Set up the necessary permissions and roles to execute the Lambda function.

3. **Adding Trigger for Automatic Data Extraction** 🕰️
   - Set up an event trigger, such as a schedule or API event, to automatically run the Lambda function for data extraction at specified intervals.

4. **Writing Transformation Function** 🔄
   - Develop a transformation function to process the extracted data and prepare it for further analysis.
   - Ensure data cleansing, formatting, and structuring according to the analytics requirements.

5. **Building Automated Trigger on Transformation Function** 🔄🕰️
   - Deploy the transformation function on AWS Lambda.
   - Configure a trigger, similar to the data extraction trigger, to automate the data transformation process.

6. **Store Files on S3 Properly** 🗄️
   - Create an AWS S3 bucket to store the extracted and transformed data securely.
   - Organize the data files in a structured manner for easy retrieval and access.

7. **Building Analytics Tables on Data Files using Glue and Athena** 📊
   - Use AWS Glue to crawl and catalog the stored data in S3, creating a data catalog.
   - Define data schemas and build analytics tables for querying with Amazon Athena.
  

     
## Future Enhancements: Data Science and Analysis 📈🧬

- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on Spotify data to gain insights into music trends and user preferences.
- Apply machine learning algorithms for music recommendation systems based on user listening habits.
- Predictive modeling to forecast music trends and identify popular songs.
- Use data visualization techniques to create informative visualizations of Spotify data.
